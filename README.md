# Hotel API INTERN HIRING Episource
 
Problem statement:
Implement a search result list for hotels:
 - When the user clicks the „Load hotels" button, the data of five hotels should be received from the API endpoint.
 - If the request was successful, show a list of hotels
 - If not, show an appropriate error message
 - When the user clicks on a „Show reviews" button, the reviews should be loaded for this
specific hotel.
 - Show the reviews in a list below the hotel information, but inside the hotel item
container.
API endpoint
To provide you with required data, here is a fake hotel server that generates random hotels and reviews. All needed documentation is published on http://fake-hotel-api.herokuapp.com/
Additional requirements
Should run without errors on current versions of Firefox, Chrome and Safari, plus Internet Explorer 10 and above. HTML should be valid for current HTML5 standards. Responsive behavior is not requested, but feel free to be creative!
